# Chess Game in Python

This is a simple implementation of a chess game in Python. The game allows two players to play against each other on a console-based interface. It follows the standard rules of chess and includes basic functionality such as moving pieces, capturing opponent's pieces, and detecting checkmate and stalemate.

## Requirements

To run the chess game, you need to have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- The following Python libraries:
  - `numpy` for board representation
  - `colorama` for console colors (optional, but recommended for better visualization)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required libraries using pip.

4. Run the game.

5. Play the game by entering the coordinates of the piece you want to move and the destination coordinates when prompted.

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to continue playing until checkmate or stalemate occurs.

## Gameplay Instructions

- The game is played on an 8x8 chessboard, with each square represented by its algebraic notation (e.g., 'a1', 'e4', 'h8').
- To make a move, enter the starting and ending coordinates of the piece you want to move. For example, to move a pawn from e2 to e4, enter 'e2' as the starting position and 'e4' as the ending position.
- The game will validate the move and display the updated board after each move.
- If a move is invalid, an error message will be displayed, and you will be prompted to enter a valid move.
- The game will continue until checkmate or stalemate occurs.
